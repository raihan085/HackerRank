Estimating the strength of any password is an important aspect of Information Security. In this challenge, your task is to calculate the strength of a given password in terms of weights assigned to the characters.

A password consists of English lowercase letters only.
Each English lowercase letter has assigned an integer weight in the range from 0 to 25 inclusive in such a way that the weight of letter  is given explicitly and weights of other letters follow in cyclic order. For example, if , then , , , , , , .
The strength of a password is the sum of weights of all characters the password consists of
Consider the following example. Let the password be  and the weight of letter  be 10. Then, the weights of all letters of the password are: , , , , , , , so the strength of the password is .
